# AFL Stats

Slowly building a great AFL Stats python package.

## Currently Supports

- Scraping [ALF Tables](https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html) for player stats.
- Applying [HPN Footy's player rating algo](https://www.hpnfooty.com/?p=21810) to the scraped stats.

## Short Term Goals

- Team stats
- Implementing remaining parts of HPN PAV algo
- Add player biography details (e.g. DOB, Height, Weight)
- Creating SQL database using AFL Tables data to prevent load on site.

## Long Term Goals

- Creating open AFL Stats API
